## Question 1
- QUESTION: Which of the following is an example of a phishing attack?
- ANSWER: Using fraudulent e-mails in order to trick a user into voluntarily providing sensitive information
- EXPLAINATION: This is correct because it describs the use of fraudulent emails to deceive individuals into divulging sensitive information, demonstrating a common tactic employed by attackers to exploit unsuspecting users' trust for malicious purposes.

## Question 12
- QUESTION: Which of the following replacements for < MISSING CODE > can be used to move the robot to the gray square?
- ANSWER: IF(CAN_MOVE(left))

{

ROTATE_LEFT()

}

MOVE_FORWARD()
- EXPLAINATION: For each iteration of the loop, this code segment rotates the robot left if there is an open square to its left. Then, whether or not the robot rotates left, the code segment attempts to move the robot forward one square. In the first three iterations of the loop, the robot moves forward three squares from its initial location. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the next three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares. In the next iteration of the loop, it rotates left. In the last three iterations of the loop, it moves forward three squares to the gray square at the bottom left corner of the grid.

## Question 48
- QUESTION: Which of the following is an example of an attack using a rogue access point?
- ANSWER: An unauthorized individual gains the ability to view network traffic by connecting to a network router that uses weak or no security measures.
- EXPLAINATION: A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.

## Question 65
- QUESTION: Assume that the Boolean variable hot is assigned the value true and the Boolean variable humid is assigned the value false. Which of the following will display the value true ?
- ANSWER: B and C
- EXPLAINATION: Since NOT humid evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since hot OR humid evaluates to true, true is displayed. Since hot OR humid evaluates to true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since hot is true, true is displayed.

## Question 69 
- QUESTION: A group of students take hundreds of digital photos for a science project about weather patterns. Each photo file contains data representing the level of red, green, and blue for each pixel in the photo. The file also contains metadata that describes the date, time, and geographic location where the photo was taken. For which of the following goals would analyzing the metadata be more appropriate than analyzing the data?
- ANSWER: Determining the chronological order of the photo and determining the chronological order of the photo
- EXPLAINATION: The location and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine whether two pictures were taken at the same location on different dates. The time and date that a photo is taken is considered metadata about the image. This information can be used to determine the chronological order of the images.

## Reflection
- Some things that I feel like I did good on this MC was time management. I ended with a lot of time left, and I feel like I allocated a decent amount for each question. I also never rushed through any questions because I had so much time left. 
- Some things that I could work on is understanding the PSUEDO code. I know that it is more basic than real code, but often the questions I struggle on is related to the code segments. I also struggle to understand some of the questions as there are multiple parts of it and they often confuse me. 
- To work on these, I will watch more Collegeboard videos to understand the concepts better.
