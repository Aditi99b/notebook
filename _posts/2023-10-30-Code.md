Here is my code for a quiz I made on html/js about lung cancer. It was put in the lung cancer section of the webpage to test users on how much they know.

## Key Github commits: 
![Alt text](<../_site/images/Screenshot 2023-11-03 093437.png>)

These are some key committs I did while working on the quiz and other interactive elements on the frontend page. An issue you can see here is the red X, which we thought was because we were having a merge error. This was annoying because no one could see the edits I had made to the code. To solve this issue, I copied my changed code into a Google Doc and deleted and recloned the frontend. This allowed my changes to be saved as you can see in these commits:
