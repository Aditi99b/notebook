## Tangibles 

I learned that collaboration and teamwork is key if we want our page to run smoothly. I also learned that next time, we should keep our content shorter so that we can meet the time requirement for the video. 

## Something I am passionate about for this project 
I am passionate about how we are going to have an interactive user interface about a topic that resonates with us all. I am very passionate about health and healthcare, and I really want to incorperate that into our project. The other team members had their own interests which we plan on combining in this project.
