### This Tri
- I learned a lot in this trimester. One of the most important things I learned in this tri was teamwork. In order to work as a team, it is important to split tasks and efficectively complete them. As Scrum Master for my group, I splilt the tasks given to us and assigned roles to people. 
- I also learned the importance of following up on my team memebers. Sometimes I would tell people to do things and they wouldn't complete it even after I gave them a week. I started to routinely check on people to make sure they are getting their tasks done. 
- I also learned to prepare early. If we are going to present in a few days, I made sure to write a practice script so we know what to talk about and make sure we cover the key concepts. 
- I also learned a lot about problem solving. I have to solve the problem, it won't solve itself. Usually I asked my team members if I face a problem, and then my peers/teachers/parents, and then Chat GPT. I learned that its ok to use my resources for help but I should learn whats happening as well. 
- All in all, I learned a lot about troubleshooting, teamworking, and most importantly, coding throughout tri 1 of this course.
