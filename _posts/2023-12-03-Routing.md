## HW Hacks 

## Question 1: What is parallel computing?
Parallel computing concurrently performs multiple tasks to enhance computational speed, dividing large problems into smaller tasks. It utilizes various architectures and programming models, such as shared-memory or distributed-memory systems, to efficiently leverage modern computing resources.

## Question 2: If there is a computer with 3 cores that can each take one task, and the tasks are 25ms, 632ms and 100ms in run time respectively, how long will the program take to run?
632 ms

## Question 3: Is sequential or parallel computing more efficient, and why?
Sequential computing is simpler and suitable for less complex tasks, while parallel computing is good forcomplex tasks that can be divided into many mini tasks. 


## Question 4: What is the term called when a network has multiple paths leading up to one destination? (Used in fault-tolerant systems)
redundancy 

## Question 5: Using the image above, is this fault tolerant?
Yes, it is because there are multiple paths to each thing so if one breaks it still works.
