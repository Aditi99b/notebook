## 4.1 Daily Video 1
- Path: is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver
- Route: is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver
- Computer System: is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose
- Computer Device: is a physical artifact that can run a program. Some examples include computers, tablets, servers, routers, and smart sensors
- Bandwidth: the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time 
- Computer Network: is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data

## 4.1 Daily Video 2
- Open standards and protocols enable different manufacturers and developers to build hardware and software that can communicate with hardware and software on the rest of the
- A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.
- HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web.

## 4.2 Daily Video 1
- Fault tolerant systems make the internet fool proof 
- A fauly tolerant system is good because it is foolproof. However it is bad because it uses a lot of resources.
- To determine if a system is fault tolerant, each computer must have at least 2 connections branching from it. 

## 4.2 Daily Video 2
- In a fault tolerant system, more devices with more network connections only makes the network stronger
- Data has more than one path to travel from one device to another.

## 4.3 Daily Video 1
- A computer needs to handle many tasks as it operates.
- Tasks need to be scheduled by the operating system and balance tasks so all CPUs are being used evenly and fully.
- Parallel computing schedule tasks to be executed at the same time.
- Sequential Computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time.
- Distributed Computing is the sending of tasks from one computer to one or more others. It is a model in which multiple devices are used to run a program.
- Parallel computing consists of a parallel portion and a sequential portion
