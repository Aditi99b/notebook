    "## What I did \n",
    "I worked on a variety of aspects with my team for the CPT Project: Login and Welcome page for the website, and the frontend and backend code for the Pulse page. On the backend code itself, it had a lot of different aspects to it. \n",
    "I worked a lot on putting CRUD Operations in my code. My code implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the database. These operations enable the manipulation of data within the pulses table, providing functionalities to create, read, update, and delete records. I also added property decorators to define getter and setter methods for the Active and Exercise attributes of the Pulse class. These decorators allow for controlled access and manipulation of the class attributes, providing a way to encapsulate data and ensure data integrity. Lastly, I worked on database Initialization Function: The initPulses() function serves the purpose of initializing the database by creating tables (db.create_all()) and populating them with test data. This function encapsulates the setup process required to start using the database, providing a convenient way to prepare the database for testing or production use.\n",

    "## N@TM\n",
    "Our team's idea for the CPT project was the fitness tracker. We aimed to have many features in our project, like a sleep and heartrate tracker. I was very interested in this topic and I see how many people can be affected by fitness and I wamted to make an impact on this issue. Our website is very interactive and throughout Night at the Museum we recieved a lot of feedback about how interactive it was. Our plans and design layouts are below. As a team we worked on handling this data efficiently, implementing data structures, and using databases align with the College Board’s emphasis on data management in computer science projects.\n",

First, the function initializes a database context, then creates database tables if they don't exist. Next, it attempts to load data from a JSON file, employing exception handling to manage potential errors. Subsequently, it iterates over each item in the loaded data, creating Pulse objects and appending them to a list. Finally, it iterates over the list of Pulse objects and attempts to add them to the database, handling integrity errors gracefully. This snippet demonstrates sequencing by outlining the order of operations, selection through conditional checks (e.g., handling exceptions), and iteration via loops over data items and Pulse objects, showcasing fundamental programming concepts. <img width=\"408\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/avanthikadaita/student2/assets/139928265/f1852835-d9b0-478b-9251-5b4693e0812b\">\n",
